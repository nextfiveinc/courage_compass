# Courage Compass: A Rejection Therapy App

Courage Compass is a self-contained, offline-first application designed to help you build confidence and overcome the fear of asking. It's a digital companion for "[Rejection Therapy](https://www.ted.com/talks/jia_jiang_what_i_learned_from_100_days_of_rejection)", a life-changing game where you intentionally seek out rejection to desensitize yourself to it and, in the process, become more resilient and fearless.

## What is Rejection Therapy?

The fear of being told "no" can stop us from pursuing our goals, asking for what we want, and making new connections. [Rejection Therapy](https://www.ted.com/talks/jia_jiang_what_i_learned_from_100_days_of_rejection) turns this on its head. By making small, safe requests where you expect to be rejected, you learn that the outcome is rarely as bad as you imagine. You build a "muscle" for courage, and you'll be surprised how often you actually get a "yes"!
