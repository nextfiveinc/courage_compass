# courage_compass
Courage Compass is a self-contained, offline-first application designed to help you build confidence and overcome the fear of asking. It's a digital companion for "Rejection Therapy," a life-changing game where you intentionally seek out rejection to desensitize yourself to it and, in the process, become more resilient and fearless.
